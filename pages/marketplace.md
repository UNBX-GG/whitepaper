# **Marketplace**


## **üé® Unique Ecosystem**

The UNBX Marketplace is designed as a **self-sustainable ecosystem** in which the listings are driven by the demand to acquire IGC by listing NFTs. The buyers are current users and IGC earners that would like to exchange their earned In-Game Currency for their favorite NFT.

The basic functions of the UNBX Marketplace are alike to current NFT marketplaces, with one crucial difference being the currency. The users are able to browse available NFTs across different collections and categories on the marketplace. **To buy and sell NFTs, the users can connect their Web3 wallet to the platform**. 



## **üîç Listing Process**

### **Immediate Exchange**

Listing an NFT is straightforward. Users decide the IGC value for their NFT, list it, and may instantly receive IGC if their price is deemed ‚Äúreasonable‚Äù by our acceleration process. This innovative approach ensures that NFTs which match our criteria swiftly transition into the game‚Äôs ecosystem, granting sellers immediate access to IGC and minimizing delays in the ecosystem. If the NFT is not approved, the seller has to wait for the NFT to sell on the marketplace (or to get Unboxed if opted-in) directly by another user. 

### **Unboxable Options**

Sellers have the option to make their NFTs ‚ÄúUnboxable,‚Äù offering them as potential rewards in single-player mode. This choice allows sellers to navigate price volatility while enabling Unboxoors to directly receive the NFT (while still being able to opt for its value equivalent in IGC instead).


## **üí∏ Purchasing NFTs**

NFTs on the marketplace are purchasable by spending IGC. Once a purchase is made, the corresponding IGC amount is deducted from the buyer‚Äôs in-game balance, and the NFT is promptly transferred to their linked Web3 wallet.


## **üîÑ Reinvestment Strategy**

To ensure the marketplace's vitality and sustainability, UNBX commits to reinvesting substantial portions of the revenue from cryptocurrency buy-ins back into the platform. This strategic approach aims to maintain a balanced and fair supply of NFTs on the marketplace.

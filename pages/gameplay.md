# **Gameplay Overview**

UNBX is available both as a single player game that allows the user to Unbox at their pace, and a multiplayer game in 3 modes: **Singles**, **Duos**, and **Three-for-All**. These game modes are played with other Unboxoors in a live setting.



## **ðŸŽ® Single Player Mode:**

The classic single player mode consists of the player choosing a Box that they wish and having the ability to open that Box for the amount of IGC listed as the price. Before Unboxing, you are able to see the content and the probabilities for Unboxing each of the reward items. Upon unboxing, the prize revealed between the on-screen indicators is yours to claim.

- **Dynamic IGC Pricing:** If your unboxed NFT isn't marked as "Unboxable," you'll receive IGC equal to the NFT's floor price, updated in real-time from leading NFT marketplaces.
- **IGC Vouchers:** Some Boxes contain IGC vouchers, offering a fair chance at winning while diversifying our Box offerings with lower-priced options.
- **Free Trial:** Test out a Box for free without keeping the reward, perfect for exploring new Boxes risk-free.

## **ðŸ‘¥ Multiplayer Mode:**

UNBX is also available in Singles (1v1), Duos (2v2), and Three-for-All (1v1v1). The first player that creates the lobby chooses the combination of Boxes that is played out in that match. The cost to join is the sum of the selected Boxesâ€™ prices in IGC. The other players can join the match by paying the equal amount of IGC. Each lobby lists how many rounds the match has (every player opens 1 Box per round), as well as what Boxes constitute each of the rounds.


### **Singles (1v1):**
- Head-to-head battles between 2 players. The player whose sum of winnings throughout all rounds is greater is rewarded with the total amount of IGC that both players Unboxed, while the losing player does not receive anything in return.


### **Duos (2v2):**
- Duos are played as head-to-head battles between 2 teams comprised of 2 players each. The team with the higher total wins the cumulative IGC, split evenly between the winning teammates, while the losing team does not receive anything in return.


### **Three-for-All (1v1v1):**
- Head-to-head-to-head between 3 players. The player whose sum of winnings throughout all rounds is the greatest is rewarded with the total amount of IGC, while the losing players do not receive anything in return.


In addition to participating, players have the option to spectate battles, immersing themselves in the excitement of UNBX without spending IGC.
